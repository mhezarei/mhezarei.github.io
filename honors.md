I've always been passionate about contests and competitions. That's why throughout the course of my B.Sc. degree I tried to participate in well-known programming contests as much as I could. Here are some of them:

### <font size="5"><center>2021 SUT AI Challenge</center></font>

[Sharif University of Technology](http://www.en.sharif.edu/) (SUT) AI Challenge is the greatest and the most famous AI Challenge in Iran. Students from all over Iran can take place in this challenge without any age restrictions. So some of the participants might be high school students and some of them might have Ph.D.s!

13th version of this challenge took place in April 2021 and over 2,000 students were competing against each other in teams. Two of my friends and I made up a team and was ranked 3rd in the challenge.

### <font size="5"><center>2020 IUST AI Challenge - Senior Section</center></font>

[Iran University of Science and Technology](http://www.iust.ac.ir/en) (IUST) AI Challenge is another famous competition which is held annually. In its 3rd version, I participated alone in the Senior Section and was ranked 1st among 100 competitors.

### <font size="5"><center>Various Nationwide Online Data Science Contests</center></font>

From time to time, some of the Iranian companies hold Data Science contests and hire the top ranked participants. Most of the problems are related to Deep Learning and their applications. I absolutely love challenging myself via these contests. Here are the contests which I took place in chronological order.

# <font size="10"><center>Work and Vol. Experience</center></font>

I'm happy to say I've been a part of a few organizations/companies throughout my university years. Here, I will explain these organizations and talk about my role in them.

### <font size="5"><center>IPM (Work)</center></font>

[The Institute for Research in Fundamental Sciences (IPM)](http://www.ipm.ac.ir/) is the most successful research center. It is composed of 9 different schools, each with a distinct field of study:

- School of Astronomy
- School of Biological Sciences
- School of Cognitive Sciences
- <ins>School of Computer Science</ins>
- School of Mathematics
- School of Nano Science
- School of Particles and Accelerators
- School of Philosophy
- School of Physics

I joined the Computer Science department as Research Assistant in Dec 2019. The Computer Science school is made up of different sections, each focusing on a specific research area. I worked at the [High-Performance Computing](https://hpc.ipm.ac.ir/) laboratory, focusing on improving the performance of different types of systems, such as FPGAs, GPUs, or Embedded Systems. The HPC center also provides high-end computation resources, such as CPUs, Multi GPUs, RAM, Hard Disks, and SSD.

Since IPM is the most prominent research center in the whole country, I already knew this place would significantly influence me and my research abilities specifically. I've had research experience before joining IPM, but it got heavily improved over the last two years, and I've gotten much better at research. I'm sure I will keep improving as long as I'm working here.

### <font size="5"><center>Digikala (Work)</center></font>

[Digikala](http://www.digikala.com/) is the biggest e-commerce company in Iran and other neighboring countries, wanting to become the biggest and the best in the whole Middle East. It is serving over 40,000,000 customers in Iran to fulfill their online shopping needs. It has 13 companies in different fields (such as books and magazines, digital content, C2C shopping) with over 8,000 employees in total. Digikala is always trying to scale its already enormous basis to provide more and more users every day while growing the company itself. For instance, they're currently looking to expand their engineering department from 200 to 500 by the end of the year.

I joined Digikala as a Data Scientist - Big Data and AI department in Aug 2021. The AI department has various problems and challenges, ranging from Intelligent Robots in the Storage section to demand prediction to user-specific Recommendation Systems. I was first introduced to all the areas in this department, and after reviewing the AI codebase, I chose to work at the Computer Vision team.

Our goal was to create an Image Embedding Space to find similarities between products based on their images. With the help of various Deep Learning models and methods, we first established a Color Detection model to help our sellers when they're submitting their products. 

After that, we considered and tested over eight different Image Embedding/Retrieval task methods and found what worked the best for us and our specific application. Now, we can find similar products using their images and make the product submission procedure easier for sellers.

### <font size="5"><center>Member of SBU AMC Club (Vol.)</center></font>

Founded in 2018 by a group of students, this is the first AI-related group ever build in our university. I joined there a year later, and I'm still enjoying all the experiences and things I learned there. Our main goal is to help newly arrived students get familiar with AI (Deep Learning in specific) and help them understand what is needed to get a basic comprehension of AI and its potential. We've held over four courses over the past few years for anyone interested in AI where we introduced this field and taught them different famous algorithms in both Machine and Deep Learning.

We also held knowledge-sharing sessions, where we would discuss a recent advance in AI and help each other be updated all the time. From time to time, we would make teams and participate in different programming contests, whether they were held nationwide (AI-bot contest) or worldwide ([Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)).

### <font size="5"><center>Main Board Member of the Scientific Association of the CES Department of SBU (Vol.)</center></font>

The Scientific Association is a group made up of students to help other students in various academic activities. Some of these activities include assisting students in organizing educational events, connecting students with the industry, and familiarizing them with their professors.

I was a board member of the Association and held the "Vice President of the Board" for 2 out of my three years. We managed the whole group and discussed long-time strategies to provide the best service we could to the students.

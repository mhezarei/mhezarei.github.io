# <font size="10"><center>About me</center></font>

I'm a Computer Engineering student at [Shahid Beheshti University](https://www.sbu.ac.ir/), Tehran, Iran. I started my AI journey in 2019 with great enthusiasm for this field ever since. I've managed to apply my knowledge to both academic and industrial scenes as I'm currently **Research Assistant** in [Institute for Research in Fundamental Sciences (IPM)](http://www.ipm.ac.ir/) (Computer Science department) and **Data Scientist** in [Digikala](www.digikala.com).

With an extensive background in the AI field, I'm more interested in domains where Artificial Intelligence and Hardware collide to provide something innovative. The **mixture of AI** (more specifically, Deep Learning) and areas like **Smart/Autonomous Systems**, **IoT**, **Robotics**, **Hardware-Accelerated AI**, and **Cyber-Physical Systems** is where my enthusiasm lies the most.

I'm also much interested and capable in problems that precisely lie in the Deep Learning area.

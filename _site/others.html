<p>Here, I’m going to talk more about myself and activities that I very much enjoy.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.dota2.com">Defence of the Ancients 2 (DotA 2)</a> is a world-known MOBA game with a massive level of complexity compared to similar games in its genre. I’ve been playing the game since 2014, and currently, I hold the “Ancient V” rank medal, which is within the top 5% of more than 7 million players worldwide (<a href="https://stratz.com/players/ranks">according to this website</a>).</p>

<p>As I said, the game is highly challenging and mind-tackling, which I love about this game. While playing, your brain is wholly involved in each second, and you need to make decisions that benefit you and your teammates’ gameplay.</p>

<p>In 2016, <a href="https://openai.com/five/">OpenAI</a> introduced a team of AI players that beat almost all the best teams and players globally. This was a breakthrough in both the AI field and the DotA 2 scene. Being a scientist in this OpenAI team is what I consider the purpose of my career!</p>

<p>By the way, this is my <a href="https://www.dotabuff.com/players/181600939">DotaBuff profile</a> if you’re interested.</p>

<hr />

<p>I’m also very much interested in Music. For as long as I remember, I’ve always enjoyed listening to different genres and exploring the culture or message behind them. Recently, I’ve started playing Electric Guitar, which is a bit harder than I thought!</p>

<hr />

<p>Chess is what I’ve loved playing seriously since childhood but haven’t gotten a chance to do so “yet.” A board game without the chance factor always catches my attention, and I think Chess is just the pinnacle of this genre.</p>

<hr />

<p>I also walk casually from time to time with my friends. It has helped a lot more in keeping my body refreshed all the time. I also like walking around the town aimlessly to discover areas I haven’t seen in my life.</p>

I'm a Computer Engineering student at [Shahid Beheshti University](https://www.sbu.ac.ir/), Tehran, Iran. I started my AI journey in 2019 with great enthusiasm for this field ever since. I've managed to apply my knowledge to both academic and industrial scenes as I'm currently **Research Assistant** in [Institute for Research in Fundamental Sciences (IPM)](http://www.ipm.ac.ir/) (Computer Science department) and **Data Scientist** in [Digikala](www.digikala.com).

This website acts as a detailed version of [my CV](https://github.com/mhezarei/mhezarei.github.io/CV.pdf) where I explain my academic career and projects.
